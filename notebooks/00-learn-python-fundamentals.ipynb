    "# Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language.\n",
    "# It is known for its simplicity and readability, which makes it a great language for beginners.\n",
    "# Python has a large and active community, which means there are plenty of resources and libraries available.\n",
    "# It is widely used in various fields such as web development, data analysis, machine learning, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Installing Python\n",
    "\n",
    "# To install Python, you can visit the official Python website at python.org and download the latest version.\n",
    "# The installation process is straightforward and usually involves running an installer.\n",
    "# Make sure to select the option to add Python to your system's PATH during the installation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Once Python is installed, you can open a terminal or command prompt and type \"python\" to start the Python interpreter.\n",
    "# This will open a Python shell where you can type and execute Python code interactively.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Alternatively, you can use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, or Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "# These IDEs provide a more feature-rich environment for writing and running Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Let's start by printing a simple \"Hello, Python!\" message to verify that Python is installed correctly.\n",

    "# Variables and Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "# In Python, variables are used to store values.\n",
    "# You can think of a variable as a container that holds a value.\n",
    "# To create a variable, you need to give it a name and assign a value to it using the assignment operator (=).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Variable Names\n",
    "# - Variable names can contain letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), and underscores (_).\n",
    "# - Variable names cannot start with a digit.\n",
    "# - Variable names are case-sensitive, so \"myVariable\" and \"myvariable\" are different variables.\n",
    "# - Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Types\n",
    "# In Python, there are several built-in data types that you can use to store different kinds of values.\n",
    "# The most common data types are:\n",
    "# - int: used to store integers (whole numbers).\n",
    "# - float: used to store floating-point numbers (numbers with a decimal point).\n",
    "# - str: used to store strings (sequences of characters).\n",
    "# - bool: used to store boolean values (True or False).\n",
    "# - list: used to store a collection of values, which can be of different data types.\n",
    "# - tuple: used to store an immutable (unchangeable) collection of values.\n",
    "# - dict: used to store key-value pairs, where each key is unique.\n",
    "# - set: used to store a collection of unique values.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Variable Assignment\n",
    "# To assign a value to a variable, you can use the assignment operator (=).\n",
    "# The value on the right side of the assignment operator is assigned to the variable on the left side.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assigning an integer value to a variable\n",
