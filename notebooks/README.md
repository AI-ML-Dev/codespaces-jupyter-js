# Generative AI, Codespaces & Notebooks

<br/>

## Using: GitHub Codespaces

### 1. Update `requirements.txt` for Python development

The `codespaces-jupyter` template sets up the default environment for  Jupyter Notebooks. Read about [using Jupyter Notebooks](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/getting-started-with-github-codespaces-for-machine-learning) on Codespaces for a quickstart.

The `devcontainer.json` file configures the Codespaces environment - installing Python packages defined in [`requirements.txt`](./../requirements.txt) into the container at startup. _I'll keep these updated to reflect DeepLearn.ai course dependencies - note that changing these files requires a container rebuild_.

### 2. Update `devcontainer.json` for other things

Some things we need to think about:
 - [Default env vars](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/default-environment-variables-for-your-codespace) - for Codespace (that you can create, read, modify)
 - [Persist custom env vars](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/persisting-environment-variables-and-temporary-files) - preset env values at codespace or repo levels
 - [Set env across ALL codespaces you create](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/persisting-environment-variables-and-temporary-files#for-all-codespaces-that-you-create) - using `dotfiles` repository.
 - [Prevent temp files being deleted](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/persisting-environment-variables-and-temporary-files#preventing-temporary-files-from-being-automatically-deleted) - by knowing `/workspaces` setup.
 - [Managing Encrypted Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/codespaces/managing-your-codespaces/managing-encrypted-secrets-for-your-codespaces ) - attach secrets to repos, access as env.

_I'll update this section with the list of secrets that we will need to setup for DeepLearning.AI courses (e.g., OpenAI key)._

## Using: GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot is described as `your friendly AI pair programmer`, offering suggestions and generating code in response to your prompts. Keep in mind that generated content may not always be correct, or optimal. 

I use it to _speed up development_ by automating repetitive tasks, _get code explanations_ for things I may be unfamiliar with, and _scaffold known project templates_ e.g., create Notebooks or Workspaces - giving me a starting point for exploration that I can then refine and validate for the actual problem at hand.

We can use Copilot in two modes:
1. The standard [Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/getting-started-with-github-copilot) feature - with _inline_ suggestions in the editor.
1.  The [Copilot Chat](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/github-copilot-chat/using-github-copilot-chat) extension - with a _standalone chat-based_ experience.

<br/>

## Using: Copilot Chat 

_**Caveat:** I'm using the Copilot Chat pre-release version which is subject to changes so YMMV based on latest updates._ 
 
Copilot Chat is interesting becuase it allows both free-form prompts (that you write from scratch) and some built-in `/<command>` prompts that have been tailored for specific use cases, including:

 - /createNotebook - create a Jupyter Notebook
 - /createWorkspace - scaffold code for new workspace
 - /explain - how code works
 - /extApi - help with VSCode Extension dev
 - /fix - suggest a fix for selected code in editor
 - /help - help me learn how to use Copilot Chat
 - /search - generate query parameters for workspace search
 - /simplify - simplify the selected code
 - /test - generate unit tests for the selected code
 - /vscode - ask questions about Visual Studio Code
 - /clear - clear the chat history

I'll primarily explore the `/createNotebook`, `/explain` and `/fix` prompts in these exercises. _Note that I a Polyglot with experience in multiple languages, but only a basic knowledge of Python. I'll be documenting my experiences in using Copilot as a JS developer skilling up on Python, Data Sciences and AI/ML_.

### 1. Notebook Creation For Prompt

The links show the prompt I used and a link to the initial notebook scaffolded by Copilot Chat. _These are not yet validated, but give a sense of how good Copilot can be at structuring a learning curriculum_.
 - /createNotebook Learn Python Fundamentals | [link](./00-learn-python-fundamentals.ipynb)
 - /createNotebook Learn Python Data Science Fundamentals | [link](./00-learn-python-datascience.ipynb)
 - /createNotebook Learn prompt engineering | [link](./01-learn-prompt-engineering.ipynb)

I'll run these next to see how well I can understand concepts and the effort needed to execute them in Codespaces - and correct any issues.

### 2. Notebook Creation For Courses

I need empty notebooks for the course so I can capture my own notes and complete the exercises. 

```bash
# Asking Copilot to create an empty notebook
/createNotebook Create an empty notebook with a title "ChatGPT Prompt Engineering For Developers"

# Result
...
GitHub Copilot
Sure! Here is an outline for a Jupyter notebook titled ChatGPT Prompt Engineering For Developers

I've added the responses into the [generated notebook](./01-chatgpt-prompt-engineering.ipynb) so we can revisit this later to compare-contrast the quality and coverage of the material with respect to the courses completed.
